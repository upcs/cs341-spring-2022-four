          <p>Nice view. Not too strenuous. Got some cool pics. I think
            got lost about halfway through because I somehow ended up in Washington

          <p>Holden Caulfield, a depressed 16-year-old, lives in an unspecified institution in California after
            the end of World War II. After his discharge within a month, he intends to go live with his brother D.B.,
            an author and war veteran with whom Holden is angry for becoming a Hollywood screenwriter.
            Holden recalls the events of a single night during the previous Christmas, beginning at Pencey
            Preparatory Academy, a boarding school in Pennsylvania. Holden has just learned that he won't be allowed
            back at Pencey after the Christmas break because he had failed all classes except English. After forfeiting a
            fencing match in New York by forgetting the equipment on the subway, he says goodbye to his history teacher,
            Mr. Spencer, who is a well-meaning but long-winded old man. Spencer offers him advice and simultaneously embarrasses
            Holden by criticizing his history exam.
            Back at his dorm, Holden's dorm neighbor,
            Robert Ackley, who is unpopular among his peers, disturbs Holden
            with his impolite questioning and mannerisms. Holden, who feels sorry for Ackley,
            tolerates his presence. Later, Holden agrees to write an English composition for his roommate,
            Ward Stradlater, who is leaving for a date. Holden and Stradlater normally hang out well together,
            and Holden admires Stradlater's physique. He is distressed to learn that Stradlater's date is Jane Gallagher,
            with whom Holden was infatuated and feels the need to protect. That night, Holden decides to go to a Cary Grant
            comedy with Mal Brossard and Ackley. Since Ackley and Mal had already seen the film, they end up just playing
            pinball and returning to Pencey. When Stradlater returns hours later, he fails to appreciate the deeply
            personal composition Holden wrote for him about the baseball glove of Holden's late brother Allie who died
            from leukemia a few years prior and refuses to say whether he slept with Jane. Enraged, Holden punches him,
            and Stradlater easily wins the fight. When Holden continues insulting him, Stradlater leaves him lying on the
            floor with a bloody nose. Holden goes to the room of Ackley, who is already asleep, and doesn't give him any
            attention. Fed up with the "phonies" at Pencey Prep, Holden decides to leave Pencey early and catches a train
            to New York. Holden intends to stay away from his home until Wednesday when his parents would have received
            notification of his expulsion. Aboard the train, Holden meets the mother of a wealthy, obnoxious Pencey
            student, Ernest Morrow, and makes up nice but false stories about her son.

          <p>I walked this with my friend. It was really fun until he knocked me out
            and tied me to a tree so that he could steal my wallet. If he just asked I would've given it to him.
            I was only carrying three bitscoin at the time.
